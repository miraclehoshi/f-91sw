It's just a small personal hobby. I'm very inspired by the F91_Kepler, but I build everything new.

**overall progress**

Supply of parts for prototype

#### **list of tests to do**
- [x] display test (it works!!)
- [x] Gyro + Accelerometer
- [ ] geomagnetic sensor
- [ ] Stepping out of the breadboard and adding a file other than readme.md
- [ ] IR receiver
- [ ] IR transceiver
- [ ] ambient light sensor
- [ ] internal storage test
- [ ] Unicode character display
- [ ] Rechargeable battery support
- [ ] wireless charging
- [ ] FPCB production for display
- [ ] DK1 - Same circuit, but larger size, programming/debug ports and LEDs
- [ ] PT1 - real-size prototype pcb

maybe something under consideration
 - crowdfunding (For more advanced features)
 - Selling on tindle? (I know that soldering is too difficult to sell as a self-made kit.)
